/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Incoming webhooks
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The only routes in this application reachable without signing in.
|
| Registered in bootstrap/app.php WITHOUT the `web` middleware group, which is
| how the CSRF requirement is met: Meta cannot hold a session cookie or carry a
| token, and a stateless route never enters the middleware that would ask for
| one. There is no session here to fixate and no cookie to steal.
|
| What stands in for the session is the signature — see
| MetaWebhookController::signatureIsValid(). Every POST is an HMAC of its own
| body under the app secret, compared in constant time, and a body that does not
| match is refused with a 403 before anything parses it.
|
| Throttled by IP. Meta's real delivery rate is far below this; the limit is
| there because the URL is public and the alternative to a 429 is an unbounded
| number of HMAC computations on attacker-supplied bodies.
|
| `provider` is constrained to the platforms that are actually built, so
| /webhooks/whatsapp/leads is a 404 rather than a route that accepts a payload
| nothing will ever process.
